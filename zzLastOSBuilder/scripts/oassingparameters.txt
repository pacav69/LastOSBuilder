Let's say you would like to pass the string Dev as a parameter, from your batch file:

powershell -command "G:\Karan\PowerShell_Scripts\START_DEV.ps1 Dev"
put inside your powershell script head:

$w = $args[0]       # $w would be set to "Dev"
This if you want to use the built-in variable $args. Otherwise:

 powershell -command "G:\Karan\PowerShell_Scripts\START_DEV.ps1 -Environment \"Dev\""
and inside your powershell script head:

param([string]$Environment)
This if you want a named parameter.

You might also be interested in returning the error level:

powershell -command "G:\Karan\PowerShell_Scripts\START_DEV.ps1 Dev; exit $LASTEXITCODE"
The error level will be available inside the batch file as %errorlevel%.
