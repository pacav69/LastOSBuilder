[SetupS]Title=DirectX Runtimes 9.0c CompleteVersion=v9.29.1974Description=Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms.Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of video games for Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Xbox, and Microsoft Xbox 360. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names "DirectX" and "Direct3D" used interchangeably.This DirectX redist installation includes all the latest and previously released DirectX runtimes. This includes D3DX, XInput, and Managed DirectX components. The DirectX runtime cannot be uninstalled so it is recommended to create a Restore Point before installing.* This version works properly with Windows 10.URL=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3b170b25-abab-4bc3-ae91-50ceb6d8fa8d|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectXCategory=DriversBuildType=ssAppApp-File Style=2 (INI)AppPath=%ProgramFiles%\MS.DirectX.RuntimesAssembly=dxsetup.exe /silentStartMenuSourcePath=DirectX Runtimes 9.0cCatalog=SystemStartMenuLegacyPrimary=- SystemStartMenuLegacySecondary=4 SystemPriorityOrder=4App-File Version=v9.17.12.3.0
