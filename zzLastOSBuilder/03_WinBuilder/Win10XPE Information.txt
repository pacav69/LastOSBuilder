Win10XPE Version 2022-12-18

**Note AV:** By its nature, Win10XPE uses programs or applications which uses functions at the core of windows.
Some AntiVirus mark them as positive. These are false alarms.
An example with NirSoft's ProduKey to Recover lost Windows product key, 12 engines detected this file as Unsafe or Hacktool, that's not true.

Blog written in 2009, the situation did not get any better.

It shouldn't be like that and it's really frustrating. The work of AV companies should be better.

They should be reprimanded for this, we are their customers.

I can only advise you to put an exclusion on the Win10XPE folder.
